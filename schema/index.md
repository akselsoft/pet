# ðŸ§± PET Schema Overview

This section defines the structural foundation of Pattern Existence Theory.  
Here you'll find how patterns, objects, and experiences are captured, interpreted, and transformed over time.

## ðŸ“‚ Sections

- [Node Types](./nodes.md)  
  What are patterns, objects, sources, sensors, and time-based nodes?

- [Edge Structures](./edges.md)  
  How relationships form between nodes and how their meanings shift.

- [Understanding Nodes](./understanding-nodes.md)  
  The backbone of PET: when, why, and how beliefs are formed â€” and whether they support or oppose existence.

- [Visual Schema Diagram](./visuals/schema-v1.png)  
  A conceptual map of the entire PET memory system.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Object nodes** represent people, places, and things.
- **Pattern nodes** represent raw inputs like sight or sound hashes.
- **Understanding nodes** track interpretations, sources, and time â€” they do not change, but get overridden.
- **Exist/Non-Exist** are not flags â€” they are nodes.

Each component contributes to a recursive, self-adaptive model of meaning.
