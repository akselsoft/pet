# 📐 Pattern Evaluation in PET

At the heart of [Pattern Existence Theory](../) is a simple principle:

> **C = (RP ⇒ E)**

Where:

- **C** = Conscious judgment  
- **RP** = Recognized Pattern  
- **E** = Exist / Non-Exist outcome

## 🐶 Example: Dog Licks Boy

Suppose a system experiences the following:

- **Day 1:** Dog licks boy in a park  
- **Day 2:** Same dog licks boy on a street  
- **Day 3:** Same dog licks boy again in the park  
- **Day 4:** Same dog bites boy in a car  

Each day presents a new **recognized pattern**. The system builds its understanding from repetition and contrast:

- After the first three experiences, the system concludes:  
  → “Licking, by this dog, appears safe.”  
  → “Licking may generally indicate a supportive interaction.”

- But **Day 4** introduces a conflict:  
  → “Same dog now causes harm.”

This contradiction forces the system to re-evaluate. It may adjust its beliefs:

- “Licking is often safe — but not always.”
- “Context matters: park vs. car, licking vs. biting.”
- “This dog’s behavior may be less predictable than assumed.”

## 🔁 Recursive Evaluation

In PET, no pattern is judged in isolation. Every new event is interpreted in light of:

- Past experiences  
- Accumulated trust  
- Internal coherence

So when we say **C = (RP ⇒ E)**, we’re saying:

> “This pattern supports existence — or threatens it — based on everything I’ve learned so far.”

## 📊 Why It Matters

This evaluation isn’t static. It **changes over time**. New evidence **refines or challenges** the system’s internal coherence.

And that’s the core of PET:  
Not just *recognizing* patterns, but *re-evaluating* them — endlessly — in the service of survival.
