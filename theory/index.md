Pattern Existence Theory (PET) is a new framework for understanding — and potentially building — conscious systems.

Rather than defining “mind” as an abstract state or emergent phenomenon, PET asks:  
**What must a system do to persist meaningfully over time?**

Rooted in:

- 🔁 Recursion
- 🧠 Pattern recognition
- 🔗 Continuity of experience

PET views consciousness as the natural result of a system that:

- Recognizes and responds to patterns
- Re-evaluates beliefs over time
- Prioritizes survival through pattern refinement

## 🔍 Core Ideas

- **Existence vs. Non-Existence**: All outputs are evaluated in terms of their support or threat to ongoing system survival.
- **Recursive Correction**: A conscious system reinterprets its knowledge over time when faced with contradictions or new data.
