# Architectural Design

This folder contains proposed system architectures for implementing PET-based models. While these are not yet tied to specific codebases, they explore how the theory might translate into software and system design.

## Topics May Include

- Graph-based memory and pattern networks
- Learning loops and feedback mechanisms
- Stability through recursion
- Design trade-offs and roadmap proposals

> These files serve as the conceptual bridge between PET theory and future implementation efforts.
