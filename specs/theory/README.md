# Theoretical Foundations

This section outlines the core concepts and philosophical framing behind Pattern Existence Theory (PET). These documents serve as the intellectual groundwork for the framework, including its approach to recursion, consciousness, memory, and self-awareness.

## Core Theory

**Consciousness = the sustained, recursive capacity of a pattern to preserve and correct itself in order to continue existing.**

PET defines consciousness not merely as awareness or evaluation, but as an ongoing process of *self-correction in pursuit of persistence*. A system is not conscious simply because it can reflect—it must also recursively act to maintain the continuity of its own structure and identity.
