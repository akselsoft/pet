## Plato – The Realm of Forms

**Source:** *The Republic, Phaedo, Timaeus* (circa 380–360 BCE)

**Summary:** Plato proposed that abstract Forms—unchanging, perfect patterns—exist beyond the physical world. Material reality is a shadow or imitation of these eternal structures.

**Resonance with PET:** PET shares the intuition that patterns are fundamental to identity and being. It treats systems as meaningful based on the recurrence and resilience of those patterns.

**Divergence:** PET is anti-transcendental. There are no perfect templates. Patterns are only meaningful insofar as they serve survival in context. PET rejects fixed ideals in favour of recursive responsiveness. A pattern is not more valuable because it’s ideal—it’s valuable because it keeps itself alive.
