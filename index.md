title: Welcome to PET

Pattern Existence Theory (PET) is a new framework for understanding—and potentially building—conscious systems. Rooted in the principles of pattern recognition, recursive self-adaptation, and continuity of existence, PET shifts the focus away from abstract definitions of “mind” and instead asks: What must a system do to persist meaningfully over time?

This repository serves as the central hub for all PET-related work, including:

	-	📖 A link to the book Towards Consciousness, available on Amazon and Apple Books (coming soon).
	-	📂 Public resources and theoretical foundations for PET.
	-	🧪 Early thought experiments and consciousness simulations.
	-	🛠️ Tools and frameworks for designing PET-aligned systems.

Whether you’re exploring artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, or systems theory, PET offers a testable model that bridges theory and implementation.
