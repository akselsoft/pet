        Pattern Existence Theory (PET) is a new framework for understanding—and potentially building—conscious systems.
        Rooted in the principles of pattern recognition, recursive self-adaptation, and continuity of existence, PET
        shifts the focus away from abstract definitions of “mind” and instead asks: What must a system do to persist
        meaningfully over time?

The theory is described in detail in the book Towards Consciousness by Andrew Ross MacNeill, available on Amazon and Apple Books (coming soon).

Here you will be able to find:

* 📂 Public resources and theoretical foundations for PET.
* 🧪 Early thought experiments and consciousness simulations.
* 🛠️ Tools and frameworks for designing PET-aligned systems.

Whether you’re exploring artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, or systems theory, PET offers a testable model that bridges theory and implementation.
