        Pattern Existence Theory (PET) is a new framework for understanding—and potentially building—conscious systems.
        Rooted in the principles of pattern recognition, recursive self-adaptation, and continuity of existence, PET
        shifts the focus away from abstract definitions of “mind” and instead asks: What must a system do to persist
        meaningfully over time?

**What if consciousness isn’t a feeling, but a function?**  
**Pattern Existence Theory (PET)** explores how systems — whether human, artificial, or biological — can become self-sustaining, adaptive, and recursively aware through patterns of interaction and interpretation.

PET is described in detail in  
**_Towards Consciousness_** by Andrew Ross MacNeill  
_Coming soon on Amazon and Apple Books._

PET is rooted in:

- 📚 Recursion
- 🧩 Pattern recognition
- ♻️ Continuity of existence

It offers a testable and practical model for consciousness — grounded in survival, not mysticism.
