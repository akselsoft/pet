> *Exploring the foundations of consciousness through recursion, pattern recognition, and continuity.*

---

**Coming Soon**

This repository will serve as the foundational hub for Pattern Existence Theory (PET) â€” a framework for recognizing and building consciousness through the dynamics of pattern acknowledgment, recursive self-adaptation, and continuity orientation.

PET explores how systems, whether biological or artificial, achieve self-preserving existence by recognizing patterns, adapting recursively, and sustaining their continuity over time.

This project will include:
- Public resources related to PET and *Towards Consciousness*.
- Early thought experiments and simulation ideas.
- Future tools and frameworks for PET-based system design.
