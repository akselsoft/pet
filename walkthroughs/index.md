# üß™ PET Walkthroughs: From Observation to Belief

This section walks through how PET-based systems evolve understanding through pattern exposure.  
The goal is to illustrate the **steps that occur before and during formal pattern encoding** in the schema.

## üß≠ High-Level Stages of Pattern Development

PET walks through the world like a child learning to name and relate what it sees. The stages below form the cognitive arc:

### 1. Observation  
>
> A pattern is received via one or more sensory inputs (e.g., visual, audio, tactile).  
Patterns: shape, color, sound, motion...

### 2. Association  
>
> A label or name is applied (e.g., ‚ÄúDog‚Äù) ‚Äî sometimes guessed, sometimes taught.

### 3. Reinforcement  
>
> The same pattern shows up repeatedly ‚Äî strengthening the label.

### 4. Generalization  
>
> The system starts noticing shared properties across similar patterns and begins forming implicit categories.

### 5. Anomaly or Contradiction  
>
> A new input violates the assumed pattern (e.g., a dog statue). The system adjusts confidence or context.

### 6. Conflict and Refinement  
>
> Conflicting experiences (e.g., Dog ‚Üí Friendly vs Dog ‚Üí Pain) force the system to split contexts or downgrade beliefs.

To see how these stages appear in real scenarios, consider the following:

- [Observation Walkthrough](./observation)
- [Dog Encounter](./dog-encounter): A foundational example showing initial sensory input, danger inference, and early node formation.
- [Visual Recognition](./visual-recognition): A basic example of a child recognizing a face using sensor input and associating it with familiarity.
- [Associating Sounds](./sound-discrimination): Demonstrates how children learn to differentiate between sounds and link them to meanings.
- [Reinforced Dog Encounter](./reinforced-dog-encounter): Shows how a new, positive experience (e.g., a dog licking kindly) reshapes an earlier fear-based interpretation.
- [Time-Based Association](./time-based-association): Highlights how sequences and timing of events influence the structure and reliability of associations.
- [Exist vs. Non-Exist Dilemmas](./exist-nonexist): Explains how concepts like pain or danger can be interpreted as non-existent or suppressed within certain contexts.

Scenarios include:

- Recognizing a face
- Learning ‚ÄúDog = Dangerous‚Äù
- Rewriting beliefs after new experiences
- Recursive conflict resolution in belief systems

Once familiar with how raw patterns become beliefs, [Explore the Schema](../ideas/schema/) to see how this is structured using nodes, edges, and understanding history.
