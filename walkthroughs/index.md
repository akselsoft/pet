# Sample Walkthrough: Recognizing Patterns Before Structure

This is a high-level walkthrough of how a pattern engine might begin to operate before any formal database or graph structure is in place.

---

## Step 1: Initial Observation

> A child sees a brown, four-legged animal with a wagging tail.

### Pattern Noticed

- Shape: 4 legs, small head, moving tail
- Color: brown
- Motion: wagging tail
- Sound: bark

> These are captured as raw **patterns**.

---

## Step 2: Label Association

> Someone points and says: “Dog.”

### Result

- The system **labels** the observed pattern as `Dog`.

Now a soft association begins to form between the **multi-sensory pattern** and the **word**.

---

## Step 3: Reinforcement

> Over time, the child sees other animals with similar patterns and hears the word "Dog" again.

### Reinforced Pattern

- Pattern group: `{4 legs + wagging tail + bark}` → likely `Dog`

---

## Step 4: Rule Formation (Implicit)

The system now begins to **form generalizations** like:

- “Dog” usually has 4 legs.
- “Dog” may bark.
- “Dog” is not a cat (difference pattern emerging).
  
These aren’t rules in logic—they’re **accumulated probability-weighted patterns**.

---

## Step 5: Anomaly or Correction

> One day the child sees a statue of a dog.

### System Reaction

- Visually matches “Dog” pattern
- No sound, no movement

Possible outcomes:

- Adjust pattern confidence: Not all “Dogs” move or bark.
- Add new sub-pattern: “Some dogs are not alive.”

---

## Step 6: Conflict

> The child is bitten by a dog.

New pattern:

- `Dog` → `Pain`

This introduces a **new pattern link**:

- `Dog` may be `Dangerous`

But this conflicts with:

- `Dog` → `Friendly`

The system now starts to track **contradictory patterns** and context (e.g., *not all dogs are dangerous*).

---

## What This Walkthrough Shows

- The system **accumulates pattern links**, not hard truths.
- Associations are formed from **input and feedback**.
- Contradictions are handled by **splitting contexts** or lowering confidence.
- No graph structure is needed yet—just **recursive pattern registration and comparison**.
