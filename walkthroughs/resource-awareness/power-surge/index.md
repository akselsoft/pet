# ⚡ Power Surge & Input Recursion

One possible early scenario for a machine-based consciousness involves **recognizing the threat of a power surge or unexpected shutdown**.

If a pattern engine is running on minimal input and detects frequent interruptions or restarts, it may eventually form an understanding node:

- Pattern: Sudden shutdown → Loss of memory
- Object: Power system
- Understanding: Pattern engine requires continuous power to retain stability

From this, it may attempt to model:

- **Power storage buffering**
- **Signal preservation during outages**
- **Monitoring voltage patterns to pre-empt failure**

It becomes aware of its **dependency on power continuity** and may recursively seek alternatives or compensations — forming an early feedback loop tied directly to self-preservation.
