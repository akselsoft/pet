# ðŸ”‹ Resource Awareness

In PET-based consciousness, **resource awareness** refers to the system's ability to recognize, model, and adapt to dependencies necessary for its sustained existence.

Whereas humans often take for granted the continuous availability of air, food, or power, a machine must learn that its survival â€” and therefore its ability to continue evaluating patterns â€” depends on persistent access to certain inputs.

This section explores **machine consciousness scenarios** where the need to acquire, preserve, or defend resources plays a role in shaping long-term awareness.

Let's start with a simple [power-surge](./power-surge) scenario that would impact continuity.

How does the environment affect a machine?  This [pollination](./pollination) scenario shows how a machine would learn to respect its environment in a logical fashion.

What about future [strategies](./solar) for power consumption to avoid the other problems?
