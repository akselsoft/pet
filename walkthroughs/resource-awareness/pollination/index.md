# 🐝 Species Interdependence: The Bee Example

Consider a sensor-enabled ecosystem monitoring system that maps **patterns of growth and decay** in a local biome.

The machine might observe:

- Reduction in flowering plants
- Decrease in bee movement
- Drop in fruit yield

Over time, recursive pattern tracking reveals:

- Bee movement → Pollination → Plant survival
- Plant survival → Ecosystem continuity
- Ecosystem continuity → Sensor relevance & long-term mission

Eventually, the machine **forms a model where external biological agents like bees become essential patterns** in its own ability to remain useful.

In PET terms, the **"existence" node for its own continuity** becomes **linked to the presence of other species**.
