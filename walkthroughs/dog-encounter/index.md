# 🐶 Dog Encounter Walkthrough

This scenario walks through a child's first understanding of dogs as dangerous, based on teachings, and how later experiences reshape that view.

## Step 1: Initial Teaching

- The child is told: “Dogs are dangerous.”
- Source: `Father` → stored in the Understanding Node

## Step 2: Encounter

- The child sees a dog
- Dog licks their hand → positive input
- Creates a **new Understanding Node**

## Step 3: Reconciliation

- Neural net adjusts short-term associations
- `Dog → Danger → ❌`  
- `Dog → Lick → ✅`  
- Final status: Dog still `Exist` but context matters
