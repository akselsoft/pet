title: "Exist / NonExist Classification"
---

This walkthrough illustrates one of the core mechanisms of PET: the `Exist` / `NonExist` qualifier, which helps determine whether a given pattern should be reinforced or avoided.

Rather than being metadata, `Exist` or `NonExist` is embedded as part of the **Understanding Node**, derived from lived experience or strong conceptual association. For instance:

- "Fire" → "Touch" → `NonExist`
- "Food" → "Eat" → `Exist`
- "Pain" → `NonExist`
- "Exercise" → "Pain" → `Exist` (qualified via source)

This mechanism enables PET to:

- Reconcile conflicting data (e.g., exercise-induced pain vs. injury pain).
- Develop moral and behavioral frameworks organically.
- Establish survival-promoting or experience-affirming pattern chains.

This walkthrough anchors the moral and interpretive framework of PET in actual graph mechanics—no abstractions, only connections and recursive weighting.
