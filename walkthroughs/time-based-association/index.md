This walkthrough explores how **Time Nodes** play a role in forming, distinguishing, and sequencing pattern interpretations within PET.

In PET, time is not a linear abstraction but a structural node connected to experiences. Each Understanding Node is associated with a moment in time (or a Time Node), allowing the system to:

- Recall when an event occurred.
- Evaluate how often a pattern has been reinforced or contradicted.
- Sequence related experiences (e.g., cause-effect or evolution of meaning).

For example:

1. A child hears "Don't touch the stove" (stored with a Time Node `T1`).
2. Later, they touch it and feel pain (Time Node `T2`).
3. Eventually, they learn to cook carefully (Time Node `T3`).

Each event connects to "Stove" and "Pain" but with different relational weights and interpretations over time.

This walkthrough demonstrates:

- How PET manages memory and learning over time.
- The structure of short-term vs. long-term associations.
- The critical role of recurrence and change in forming stable interpretations.
