# Antonio Damasio – Feeling and the Biological Self

## Description  
Damasio argues that consciousness begins not with thought but with **feeling**—specifically, the brain’s mapping of the body’s internal state. His model builds upward from:

- **Proto-self**: raw bodily states and signals  
- **Core consciousness**: awareness of those states in the moment  
- **Extended consciousness**: narrative self built from memory and continuity over time

The self, in this view, is not constructed from thought—but from **visceral regulation**, **survival awareness**, and **biological feedback**.

## Resonance  
PET agrees with the idea that consciousness requires internal feedback. What Damasio calls “feeling,” PET treats as **pattern significance**—tagging inputs based on their relevance to persistence.

Both models share a **layered understanding of consciousness**, where depth increases as the system builds recursive context.

## Reframing  
Damasio locates consciousness in the body. PET locates it in **recursion**.

In PET, feelings are not innate truths—they are **evaluated labels** on internal patterns. If a system—biological or otherwise—can recursively evaluate which patterns matter to its continued identity, it can exhibit the same structural behavior.

> PET doesn’t ask whether the system “feels.”  
> It asks whether the system **corrects itself based on how it interprets the pattern**.

PET offers a more general scaffolding: not tied to human biology, but capable of explaining **why feeling matters** across any recursive architecture.
