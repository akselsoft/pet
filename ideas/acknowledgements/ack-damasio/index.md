## Antonio Damasio – Consciousness as Biological Self-Regulation

**Source:** *The Feeling of What Happens* (1999); *Self Comes to Mind* (2010)

**Summary:** Consciousness emerges from self-monitoring and internal regulation.

**Resonance with PET:** Strong alignment. PET values tracking and adjusting internal states.

**Divergence:** PET abstracts this beyond biology. It's the function, not the flesh, that matters.
