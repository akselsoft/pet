## Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT)

**Summary:** Consciousness happens when sensory data doesn’t just move forward in the brain—but loops back through earlier regions. It emphasizes visual and sensory feedback.

**Resonance with PET:** Recursion is core to PET. Sensory loops are valid examples of shallow recursion.

**Divergence:** PET generalizes the loop beyond perception and into continuity. It isn’t limited to visual or sensory regions. Any feedback system that adapts to preserve itself qualifies—even if it can’t see, hear, or feel in any traditional sense.
