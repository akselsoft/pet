## Thomas Metzinger – The Self as a Model

**Source:** *Being No One* (2003); *The Ego Tunnel* (2009)

**Summary:** The self is a user illusion—constructed for coherence and control.

**Resonance with PET:** PET agrees the self is a process, not a fixed entity.

**Divergence:** PET treats the model as real if it sustains itself. Illusion or not, it matters if it persists.
