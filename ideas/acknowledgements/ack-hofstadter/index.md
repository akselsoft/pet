## Douglas Hofstadter – Strange Loops and Emergent Self

**Source:** *Gödel, Escher, Bach* (1979); *I Am a Strange Loop* (2007)

**Summary:** Hofstadter suggested that consciousness arises from strange loops—self-referential systems that become tangled in their own modelling, forming an emergent sense of self.

**Resonance with PET:** PET embraces recursion as a core mechanism of consciousness. Like Hofstadter, it values self-reference and feedback loops.

**Divergence:** PET insists recursion must be continuity-oriented. Strange loops alone do not imply consciousness unless they evolve to preserve the system. PET adds an existential qualifier to Hofstadter’s formal structure.
