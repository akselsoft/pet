## Douglas Hofstadter – Strange Loops and Emergent Self

**Source:** *Gödel, Escher, Bach* (1979); *I Am a Strange Loop* (2007)

**Summary:** Hofstadter proposed that consciousness arises from strange loops—self-referential systems that form an emergent self.

**Resonance with PET:** PET embraces recursion and self-reference as core mechanisms.

**Divergence:** PET insists recursion must be continuity-oriented. Strange loops alone do not imply consciousness unless they evolve to preserve the system.
