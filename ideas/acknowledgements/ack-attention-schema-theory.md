## Attention Schema Theory (AST)

**Summary:** Consciousness is the brain modelling its own attention. Like proprioception models your body, consciousness is your brain’s way of tracking what it’s focusing on.

**Resonance with PET:** PET supports modelling. Awareness of patterns is central to survival.

**Divergence:** PET doesn’t stop at modelling. The model must be used to adapt behaviour in the service of persistence. An attention schema that fails to adjust the persistence-relevant behaviour is, at best, cosmetic recursion under PET.
