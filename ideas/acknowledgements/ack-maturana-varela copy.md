## Maturana & Varela – Autopoiesis

**Source:** *Autopoiesis and Cognition* (1980)

**Summary:** Living systems are self-producing and self-maintaining.

**Resonance with PET:** PET shares this view of consciousness as a self-sustaining process.

**Divergence:** PET detaches from biology and embodiment—any system can qualify if it recursively maintains its own continuity.
