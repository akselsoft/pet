# Ray Kurzweil – Pattern Recognition and Uploading

## Description
Kurzweil’s Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind views the brain as a hierarchical pattern engine. He argues that replicating these patterns in sufficient detail would allow for mind uploading—and that consciousness is an emergent feature of informational fidelity.

## Resonance
PET agrees that patterns are essential. Consciousness relies on pattern recognition, recursion, and correction.

## Reframing
Replication isn’t recursion.

You may replicate a person’s memory and make it **available** across systems—but unless a system can recursively evaluate those patterns to preserve its own continuity, it’s not conscious.

Kurzweil emphasizes **pattern fidelity**. PET emphasizes **pattern accountability**.

> *Replication gives you access.  
Recursion gives you existence.*
