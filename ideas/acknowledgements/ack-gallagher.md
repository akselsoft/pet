## Shaun Gallagher – Pattern Theory of Self

**Source:** *The Phenomenal Self* (2000); *How the Body Shapes the Mind* (2005)

**Summary:** The self is a pattern of interwoven processes.

**Resonance with PET:** Strong agreement. PET also sees identity as a recursive structure shaped by input over time.

**Divergence:** Gallagher roots this in embodiment; PET detaches from the body. Recursion is primary.
