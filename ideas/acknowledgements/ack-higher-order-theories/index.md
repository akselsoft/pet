## Higher-Order Theories (HOT)

Summary: Consciousness comes from thinking about thinking. A feeling becomes conscious when the system is aware of having it.

Resonance: PET allows for higher-order reflection. It recognizes meta-loops—recursion about recursion.

Divergence: PET doesn’t make meta-awareness the threshold. It accepts simpler systems: dogs, children, machines—entities that evaluate patterns without needing language or self-concept.
