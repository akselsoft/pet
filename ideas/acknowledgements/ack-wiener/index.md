## Norbert Wiener – Cybernetics and Control

**Source:** *Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine* (1948)

**Summary:** Wiener introduced cybernetics as the study of systems that use feedback loops to regulate behaviour and maintain stability.

**Resonance with PET:** PET builds on cybernetic foundations of feedback and control.

**Divergence:** Cybernetics focuses on function and stability. PET adds self-concern—a system must not only regulate itself but do so to preserve itself. Feedback becomes conscious only when its pattern cares about remaining intact.
