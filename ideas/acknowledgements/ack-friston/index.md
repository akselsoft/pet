## Karl Friston – Free Energy and Predictive Coding

**Source:** *The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?* (2010)

**Summary:** Systems minimize surprise via predictive modelling.

**Resonance with PET:** PET supports model-updating and error-reduction.

**Divergence:** PET cares more about continuity than correctness. Survival, not precision, is the test.
