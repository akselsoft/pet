# Karl Friston – Free Energy Principle

## Description  
Friston’s Free Energy Principle (FEP) claims that all living organisms minimize “free energy,” a measure of surprise or prediction error in their internal model of the world. According to FEP, organisms persist by constantly updating their internal model to reduce the gap between expectation and actual input—effectively minimizing informational surprise.

This model is framed in statistical and Bayesian terms. The system acts to reduce uncertainty—either by adjusting its predictions (internal inference) or by taking action to make the world conform to its predictions.

## Resonance  
PET agrees with the importance of recursive model updating. Both theories see the need for systems to adjust based on feedback, using prior history to guide behavior. Both also emphasize the role of “surprise” or deviation as a trigger for change.

PET even accepts that minimizing prediction error may be a **symptom** of a well-formed recursive engine.

## Reframing  
Friston defines system purpose in terms of **surprise minimization**. PET reframes that purpose as **existence maximization**.

Surprise is not the core metric—**continuity is**. A system may embrace surprise if it leads to extended viability, learning, or resource access. PET views surprise as **a recursive input**, not the end goal.

Where FEP remains grounded in biology and Bayesian inference, PET provides a **platform-independent model**. PET shows not just that a system adapts—but how and when those adaptations tie back to its survival identity.
