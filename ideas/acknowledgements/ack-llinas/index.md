# Rodolfo Llinás – Oscillatory Consciousness

## Description
Llinás argues that consciousness arises from the rhythmic, ongoing electrical activity in the brain—especially the thalamocortical loop. He emphasizes 40 Hz oscillations as a potential basis for unified conscious experience, even in the absence of sensory input.

## Resonance
PET agrees that continuity in internal signaling is critical for sustained pattern evaluation. A recursive pattern engine, like Llinás’s oscillatory loop, is consistent with PET’s requirement for sustained self-modeling.

## Reframing
Llinás hears the **music** and calls it consciousness.  
PET asks: *what is the band trying to play—and why does it care if the song continues?*

Rhythm may be the **sound** of patterns being evaluated. But PET says consciousness isn’t about keeping the band in rhythm—it’s about **keeping the band together**. Continuity—not synchronization—is the purpose.

PET adds: just because a loop exists doesn’t mean it evaluates anything recursively. A metronome ticks. That’s not a mind.
