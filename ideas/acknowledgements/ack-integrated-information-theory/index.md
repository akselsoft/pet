## Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

Summary: A system is conscious if it holds information in an interconnected way that can’t be broken into parts. It assigns a value (Φ, or phi) to measure how integrated the system is.

Resonance: PET supports the idea that systems are more than their pieces. Recursion must operate on integrated memory.

Divergence: PET doesn’t care how much information is bound but whether the system evaluates that information in the service of continuity. High phi is interesting—but not sufficient.
