# David Chalmers – The Hard Problem and Non-Reduction

## Summary  

David Chalmers is known for framing the [**“hard problem of consciousness”**](<https://consc.net/papers/facing.html)—the> question of why subjective experience arises from physical processes at all. While most theories focus on *how* the brain processes information, Chalmers asks *why* those processes should feel like anything from the inside.

He proposes **property dualism** or **panpsychism** as possible answers: the idea that consciousness might be a fundamental property of the universe, much like mass or charge.

## Resonance  

PET respects the framing of the problem: not every system that processes information is conscious. PET also rejects shallow reductionism and agrees that *recursive context and continuity* are what separate inert data from conscious interpretation.

## Reframing  

Where Chalmers stops at **mystery**, PET offers a structural mechanism.

Chalmers says: “We don’t know why consciousness arises.”  
PET says: “It arises when a system recursively evaluates patterns to preserve its own existence.”

Subjective experience—what it “feels like”—is not a bonus trait. It’s a **recursive effect** of patterns being reinterpreted in light of their continuity. PET doesn’t posit a new property—it models how such experiences emerge from **recursive structure**, not brute matter.

> PET reframes the “hard problem” as a **modeling gap**, not a metaphysical wall.
