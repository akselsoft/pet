## Attention Schema Theory (AST)

Summary: Consciousness is the brain modelling its own attention—its selective focus on certain inputs over others—so it not only knows what it is paying attention to but also what it should be. This internal schema enables the system to predict and coordinate behavior, much like a body schema tracks limbs and motion to guide physical action. Awareness, then, is not an emergent magic—it’s a simplified self-model that regulates attention for better control.

Resonance: PET aligns with AST in emphasizing internal modelling. In PET, this corresponds to recognizing and recursively evaluating patterns. The ability to direct attention toward the most survival-relevant patterns is central to adaptive continuity. Both theories agree: self-modelling is critical for flexible, purposeful behavior.

### Reframing

Where AST treats attention modelling as the functional basis for awareness, PET frames it within a broader recursive imperative: continued existence. In PET, attention alone is insufficient—what matters is whether the system evaluates why it’s attending to something, and whether that attention sustains the system. Cameras and sensors can focus input—what PET demands is recursive evaluation of that focus. Consciousness isn’t just noticing; it’s “caring,” through evaluation, which patterns matter—because persistence is at stake.
