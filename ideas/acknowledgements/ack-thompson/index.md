# Evan Thompson – Enactivism and Becoming

## Description
Thompson proposes that consciousness emerges from an organism’s embodied interaction with the world. He emphasizes the role of experience, memory, and time in shaping consciousness, describing it as a **process of becoming**.

## Resonance
PET resonates with the processual nature of consciousness and the importance of recursive pattern evaluation informed by history and context. Both agree that consciousness is not static—it unfolds over time.

## Reframing
PET clarifies and expands Thompson’s ideas:

1. PET is **form-independent**—consciousness doesn’t require a human body, only recursive evaluation tied to continuity.
2. The **body is input**. It shapes content, not the mechanism. Consciousness isn’t grounded in anatomy but in recursion.
3. “Becoming” is not just experiential—it’s a recursive trace of patterns evaluated for survival. PET shows *how* becoming works structurally, not just phenomenologically.
