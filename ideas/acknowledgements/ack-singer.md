## Peter Singer – Expanding the Moral Circle

**Source:** *Animal Liberation* (1975); *Practical Ethics* (1979)

**Summary:** Singer argues for extending moral consideration to non-human animals based on their capacity to suffer. Sentience—not species—is the ethical threshold.

**Resonance with PET:** PET expands moral consideration beyond species boundaries. Both recognize that capacity matters.

**Divergence:** PET may assign relevance to systems that lack sentience but show recursive survival behaviour, and withhold it from sentient beings without a self-model. This is a structural, not moral, judgment.
