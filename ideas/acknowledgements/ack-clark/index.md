## Andy Clark – The Extended Mind and Predictive Processing

**Source:** *Being There* (1997); *Surfing Uncertainty* (2015)

**Summary:** Minds extend into body/environment and constantly update predictive models.

**Resonance with PET:** PET supports distributed consciousness and dynamic coupling.

**Divergence:** PET focuses on survival loops, not just prediction. Continuity is the core test.
