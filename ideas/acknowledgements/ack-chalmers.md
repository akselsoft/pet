## David Chalmers – The Hard Problem of Consciousness

**Source:** *Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness* (1995); *The Conscious Mind* (1996)

**Summary:** Chalmers distinguishes between easy problems (function) and the hard problem (subjective experience).

**Resonance with PET:** PET does not reject qualia, but sidesteps them. It defines consciousness operationally.

**Divergence:** PET treats subjective feeling as non-essential. It cares about recursive evaluation and persistence.
