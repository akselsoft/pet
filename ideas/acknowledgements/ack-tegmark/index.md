## Max Tegmark – Consciousness as a State of Matter (“Perceptronium”)

**Source:** *Consciousness as a State of Matter* (2014); *Life 3.0* (2017)

**Summary:** Tegmark speculates that consciousness could be seen as a new state of matter—one defined by the ability to store, process, and integrate information across space and time.

**Resonance with PET:** PET appreciates the idea that consciousness emerges from information patterns, not substances. It also values the emphasis on time-bound integration.

**Divergence:** PET rejects the classification of consciousness as a substance or state. It sees it instead as a historical, probabilistic behaviour—one that only earns credibility through sustained recursion. Consciousness is not a physical property. It is a recursive act repeated over time.
