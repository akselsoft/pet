## Max Tegmark – Consciousness as a State of Matter (“Perceptronium”)

**Source:** *Consciousness as a State of Matter* (2014); *Life 3.0* (2017)

**Summary:** Consciousness is a state defined by information storage and processing.

**Resonance with PET:** PET aligns with information-based views of consciousness.

**Divergence:** PET rejects physical classification. Consciousness is recursive, not a substance.
