## Aristotle – Soul as the Organizing Form

**Source:** *De Anima* (circa 350 BCE)

**Summary:** Aristotle described the soul as the “form” of a living body—its essential pattern of organization that gives matter its life functions. The soul isn’t separate from the body; it is the body’s realization of purpose and function.

**Resonance with PET:** PET agrees that a system’s identity lies in its pattern, not its matter. There is conceptual alignment in seeing consciousness not as a substance, but as a structure-in-motion.

**Divergence:** Aristotle’s soul is anchored in biology and telos (purpose). PET detaches from biological form and instead focuses on functional recursion—the system’s ability to detect, reflect, and re-evaluate patterns to preserve itself. Consciousness, in PET, does not depend on biology or a human sense of purpose.
