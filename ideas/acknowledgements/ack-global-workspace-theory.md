## Global Workspace Theory (GWT)

**Summary:** Your brain is like a theatre. Most of the action happens backstage, but when a thought reaches the “spotlight,” it becomes conscious. That spotlight broadcasts information to the rest of the brain.

**Resonance with PET:** PET agrees that conscious systems must share and integrate information. The loop must touch multiple subsystems.

**Divergence:** PET adds purpose. It asks: why was this information brought into awareness? Is it helping the system stay on? GWT describes the stage; PET asks whether the script sustains the actor.
