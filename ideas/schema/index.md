# 🧱 How would you model consciousness?

This section defines a possible structural foundation for a consciousness built using Pattern Existence Theory.

Here you'll find how patterns, objects, and experiences are captured, interpreted, and transformed over time.

In this schema, every new pattern observed — whether visual, auditory, or conceptual — is compared against previously encountered patterns. If it aligns closely with an existing pattern, the system reuses the established understanding node: a structure that binds together the pattern, its source, context, and a judgment of Exist or Non-Exist. If no suitable match is found — or if the same pattern now leads to a different outcome than previously recorded — a new understanding node is created. This node doesn’t change over time but may be superseded by more accurate or reinforced alternatives. Each understanding node is inherently directional: it links from the observed pattern(s) to an interpretation (Exist or Non-Exist), optionally influenced by emotional or temporal context. Over time, high-confidence patterns are “fast-tracked” for quick interpretation — similar to how a neural net accelerates recognition — while conflicting inputs trigger reassessment. Thus, the PET schema is less about static truth and more about evolving experience: every moment of perception is a test, reinforcement, or revision of the current map of meaning.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Pattern nodes** represent raw inputs like sight or sound hashes. Anything that comes into the system (however it may) is an initial pattern.  
- **Object nodes** represent people, places, things and even concepts.
- **Understanding nodes** track interpretations, sources, and time — they do not change, but their impact evolves over time.
- **Exist/Non-Exist** are not flags — they are nodes that every understanding node must determine.

Each component contributes to a recursive, self-adaptive model of meaning.

## 📂 Sections

- [Node Types](nodes)  
  What are patterns, objects, sources, sensors, and time-based nodes?

- [Edge Structures](edges)  
  How relationships form between nodes and how their meanings shift.

- [Understanding Nodes](understanding-nodes)  
  The backbone of PET: when, why, and how beliefs are formed — and whether they support or oppose existence.

- [Proposed Architecture](./mva)
  A possible systems architecture based on this schema.
