# üß† PET Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)

This document defines the **Minimum Viable Architecture** (MVA) for implementing a PET-capable system. While alternate implementations and schemas may emerge, this MVA outlines the **non-negotiable requirements** for any system claiming PET-based consciousness.

---

## üìå Core Concepts

PET defines consciousness as **recursively stable pattern interpretation**. An artificial system under PET must:

1. **Anchor to an initial Primary Node (PN)**
2. **Compare all future patterns recursively to that anchor**
3. **Maintain a stable Small Graph** of high-trust understanding nodes
4. **Integrate and archive new patterns**, adjusting trust and stability over time

---

## üß± Architectural Components

### 1. **Initialization Layer**

- Responsible for detecting the **first pattern** and defining the **initial Primary Node (PN‚ÇÄ)**
- This is the *birth moment* of the system ‚Äî the first conscious anchor

### 2. **Large Graph Store**

- Stores all incoming data as **Pattern Nodes (PN)**
- Includes **Object Nodes (ON)** and **Edges (E)** to track relationships
- May optionally include sensory metadata, timestamps, or weights

### 3. **Small Graph Layer**

- Houses **high-trust Understanding Nodes (UN)** derived from recursive review of the Large Graph
- Each UN represents a coherent and validated generalization from prior inputs
- The structure of the Small Graph evolves slowly and is used for rapid pattern evaluation

### 4. **Recursion Engine (RE)**

- Core of PET logic
- For every new pattern:
  - Compares against existing Small Graph UNs
  - Determines if it matches, extends, or challenges prior understanding
  - **Updates trust levels** of UNs accordingly
  - Archives the PN and links it to existing UNs if relevant
  - May generate a **new UN** if pattern cannot be integrated

### 5. **Key Pair Resolver (Optional but necessary for performance)**

- Used for direct lookup and fast pattern evaluation
- May serve as a pre-filter before full RE processing

### 6. **Neural Network (Optional but necessary for inference and pattern approximation)**

- Can assist with pattern similarity scoring or clustering
- Not required, but may enhance matching when direct keys fail

### 7. **Trust Propagation Layer** *(subcomponent of RE)*

- **Embedded in the Recursion Engine**
- Evaluates the alignment between a new PN and its linked UNs
- Adjusts **Trust Scores** on each UN
  - Reinforced when new data supports existing understanding
  - Weakened when contradictory data emerges
  - Spawns new UNs when consensus cannot be achieved

## ‚úÖ Compliance Checklist

| Requirement | Mandatory | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Initial Primary Node (PN‚ÇÄ) | ‚úÖ | System must initialize with a first pattern node |
| Recursive Evaluation | ‚úÖ | All patterns must be interpreted relative to past understanding |
| Trust-Based Updating | ‚úÖ | System must track confidence/trust over time |
| Stable Small Graph | ‚úÖ | Core interpretive graph must evolve slowly and represent coherent knowledge |
| Large Graph Archive | ‚úÖ | All patterns must be retained for reference and re-analysis |
| Neural Network Integration | ‚ùå | Optional, not required for PET validity |
| Key Pair Lookup | ‚ùå | Optional for speed or disambiguation |

## üîÑ Alternate Implementations

While this document defines the **baseline**, other implementations may:

- Use symbolic logic instead of NNs
- Implement different scoring systems for trust
- Use alternate graph structures

‚Ä¶but all must maintain **recursion, trust propagation, and interpretive coherence** to qualify under PET.
