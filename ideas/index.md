# 💡 Ideas

This section collects **explorations** and **working concepts** based on the Pattern Existence Theory (PET). While the core theory remains structural and implementation-agnostic, the entries here propose ways it might be applied, modeled, tested, or challenged.

Ideas may take the form of:

- 🧪 **Thought Experiments** — like using PET to explain transporter paradoxes in *Star Trek* or contradictions in memory.
- 🧭 **Walkthroughs** — [narrative journeys](../walkthroughs) like how a child learns the concept of “dog,” showing PET in action before structure emerges.
- 🧱 **Schema Proposals** — concrete ways to implement PET, such as the [`GraphPET` node-edge model](./schema)

Think of this area as a **sandbox**: informal, provocative, and always open to iteration. Some ideas may evolve into standalone tools or blog posts. Others exist to stretch the boundaries of what PET might enable.

## 🚀 Got an Idea?

If something sparks while reading — a contradiction, an experiment, or a better way to model PET — you're invited to [share](https://github.com/akselsoft/pet/issues) it.

We treat ideas here as patterns worth evolving.
