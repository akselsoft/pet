# Towards Consciousness: Exploring Pattern Existence Theory (PET)

Welcome. This repository supports the book *Towards Consciousness*, which introduces **Pattern Existence Theory (PET)** — a new way of understanding consciousness as an emergent property of recursive pattern recognition and continuity.

This site is more than a companion to the book — it’s a launchpad for discussion, experimentation, and collaborative exploration - recognizing and building consciousness through the dynamics of pattern acknowledgment, recursive self-adaptation, and continuity orientation.

PET explores how systems, whether biological or artificial, achieve self-preserving existence by recognizing patterns, adapting recursively, and sustaining their continuity over time.

> *PET isn't just a theory about machines. It's a theory about what it means to exist — as a mind, as a pattern, as a person.*
