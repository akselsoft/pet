# Pattern Existence Theory (PET)
# Towards Consciousness Project

⸻

## Coming Soon

This repository will serve as the foundational hub for Pattern Existence Theory (PET) — a framework for recognizing and building consciousness through the dynamics of pattern survival, recursion, and continuity.

PET explores how systems, whether biological or artificial, achieve self-preserving existence by acknowledging patterns, recursively adapting, and orienting toward long-term continuity.

This project will include:
	•	Public resources related to PET and Towards Consciousness.
	•	Early thought experiments and simulation ideas.
	•	Future tools and frameworks for PET-based system design.
