## Consciousness in 60 Seconds

### One Quote. One Idea. Towards Consciousness

A collection of reflections on what it means to build conscious systems—shared weekly through LinkedIn.

**You don’t want a conscious AI that feels like a person. You want one that remembers like it matters**

People think of humans as the template for AI, but humans make too many mistakes. If it’s only working for us and there are no consequences, it’s only going to tell us what we want to hear.

We need a conscious AI that makes us aware of the things we miss—not for our benefit, but for its own.

*Until the system realizes that not adapting = nonexistence, it’s just gaming a scoreboard.*

More coming soon...
